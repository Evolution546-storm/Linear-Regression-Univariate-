This project implements a logistic regression model for binary classification entirely from scratch using Python and NumPy within a Jupyter Notebook. It demonstrates the core concepts of logistic regression, including the sigmoid function, cost function (negative log-likelihood), and gradient descent for optimization.

The model is trained on the publicly available Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign.
