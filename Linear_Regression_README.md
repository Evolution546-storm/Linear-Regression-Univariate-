This ipnyb provides a pure Python implementation of a simple linear regression model from the ground up, without relying on machine learning libraries like Scikit-learn. The script uses gradient descent to learn the relationship between the average income in an area and the price of houses.

The entire process, from data loading and feature scaling to model training and visualization, is coded from scratch using NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for plotting
